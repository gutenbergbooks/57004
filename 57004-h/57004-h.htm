<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<br />
“THE LADY OF THE LAKE”</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> charm that lies in a mysterious name has
been amply exemplified in that of the Trossachs,
which is said to mean “bristled territory.”
Something in the shaggy uncouthness of the
word fits so well with the land of romance and
mountain scenery that it has drawn tens of
thousands to make the round between Glasgow
and Edinburgh, by rail and coach and steamer,
who, if the name had not been so mysteriously
attractive, might never have bestirred themselves
at all. Since the publication of <cite>Rob Roy</cite> and <cite>The
Lady of the Lake</cite> the principal actors in these
dramas have been just as real and important to
the imaginative tourist as the familiar names of
history. It is nothing to them that Rob Roy, of the
clan of Macgregor, was merely a Highland thief:
his character, invested by Scott with the charm of
a magician’s pen, has made him as heroic as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
great Wallace himself; while Ellen, the Lady
of the Lake, wholly born of the poet’s imagination,
has become only second to Mary Queen
of Scots.</p>

<p>Scott has certainly done much for the land of
his birth: not only has he enriched its literature
for all time, and raised its literary standing in the
eyes of nations, but he has done more for it
commercially than almost any other writer has
ever done for any country in bringing to it
streams of visitors, especially from across the
Atlantic. The gold flowing from the coffers of
the Sassenach into the pouches of the Gael is
a perennial blessing which could hardly have
been secured in any other way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“The Lady of the Lake”</div>

<p>We are told that on the appearance of <cite>The
Lady of the Lake</cite>, “the whole country rang
with the praises of the poet; crowds set off to
view the scenery of Loch Katrine, till then comparatively
unknown; and as the book came out
just before the season for excursions, every house
and inn in that neighbourhood was crammed
with a constant succession of visitors. From the
date of the publication of <cite>The Lady of the
Lake</cite>, the post-horse duty in Scotland rose in an
extraordinary degree, and it continued to do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
for a number of years, the author’s succeeding
works keeping up the enthusiasm for our scenery
which he had originally created.”</p>

<p>There are fairer spots in Scotland than the Trossachs,
beautiful as they are; yet, notwithstanding
this, their popularity remains unabated. The trip
certainly has the advantage of being accessible; it
can be “done” in a day from either Edinburgh
or Glasgow, and this is a great recommendation
to those who are going on to “do” Europe in
record time. Then, again, anyone who has seen
Edinburgh and the Trossachs is fairly safe in
saying he has seen Scotland, whereas one of wider
range, who had, say, gone up the Highland Railway
to Inverness and returned via the Caledonian
Canal, if unmindful of the Trossachs, would be
taunted with his omission every time the subject
was mentioned.</p>

<p>However, the greatly increased facilities of
steamer and rail do doubtless tend to send people
farther afield, and the much longer round via the
Caledonian Canal can count its hundreds where
it previously counted units.</p>

<p>Until Scott’s time the Trossachs were little
known, but then the cult of scenery-worship as
we know it had not been evolved. That they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
were somewhat known is shown in Dorothy
Wordsworth’s <cite>Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>When William Wordsworth, with his sister
and the poet Coleridge, made a tour in 1803, they
were met at Loch Katrine (coming from Loch
Lomond) with stares of amusement from the peasants.
“There were no boats,” says Dorothy in her
<cite>Journal</cite>, “and no lodging nearer than Callander,
ten miles beyond the foot of the lake. A laugh
was on every face when William said we were
come to see the Trossachs; no doubt they thought
we had better have stayed at our own homes.
William endeavoured to make it appear not so
very foolish by informing them that it was a
place much celebrated in England, though
perhaps little thought of by them.” This was
six years before the publication of the great
poem.</p>

<p>The Trossachs proper are the irregularly-shaped
hills and rocks, covered with a thick growth of
bristling firs, that lie between Loch Katrine and
Loch Vennachar, and along the shores of little
Loch Achray. But the name is generally taken
to mean the whole round, including the traversing
of Loch Lomond, as well as Loch Katrine,
and the road journey.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600"><a id="ben_venue"></a>
<img src="images/illus_fp_09.jpg" width="600" height="843" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“BENEATH THE CRAGS OF BEN VENUE.”</p>

<p class="center">The precipitous ascents from the south-east corner of Loch Katrine.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p>Much the most usual route is from either
Glasgow or Edinburgh, via Callander; but a
secondary one, which has great attraction for
some people, is that by Aberfoyle, which cuts
into the heart of the Trossachs from the south.
This has the disadvantage of missing Loch
Vennachar; but, truth to tell, the coach drive
along by Loch Vennachar is not beautiful, and
were it not illumined by romantic imagination,
and regarded as a prelude or epilogue to
something better, it could easily be dispensed
with.</p>

<p>The outline of the story of <cite>The Lady of the
Lake</cite> is supposed to be known to everyone,
but there are few who could give it off-hand.
The principal character, and the only one not
fictitious, is that of James V. of Scotland, and his
habit of wandering incognito among his people
is used to further the plot. The poem opens with
a stag-hunt, when the fine animal, after leading
his pursuers a tremendous dance, plunges into
the Trossachs and disappears from view. Only
one horseman has been able to follow up the chase,
and his steed at this juncture drops down dead,
leaving his master to scramble onward to Loch
Katrine as best he can. This he does, and as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
stands on the shore he sees a boat rowed by a
young girl rapidly approaching, coming out
from a little island. She tells him he is expected&mdash;in
fact, his visit has been foretold by a soothsayer,
Allan Bane&mdash;and asks him to come to the island
and receive the hospitality of her father’s house.
She is Ellen, daughter to one of the outlawed
Douglases, who have been in arms against their
King.</p>

<p>The girl’s mother receives the stranger
courteously on his arrival, and he announces
himself as James Fitz-James. He remains with
them that night, and leaves next morning before
the return of Douglas with Ellen’s young lover,
Malcolm Graeme, and a powerful rebel, Roderick
Dhu, the head of Clan MacAlpine, the Macgregors.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">An outlawed desperate man,</div>
<div class="verse">The chief of a rebellious clan.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This man tries to gain Ellen’s hand as the
price of his support of her father, but his suit is
unsuccessful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fiery Cross</div>

<p>The next day, determined on a wild rising
against the King, who is known to be at Stirling
with his Court, Roderick sends the fiery cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
round to summon his followers to Lanrick Mead.
The cross is made by the priest&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A cubit’s length in measure due,</div>
<div class="verse">The shaft and limbs were rods of yew.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This was dipped in the blood of a slaughtered
goat and scathed with flame. Then the priest
shook it on high, shouting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Woe to the wretch who fails to rear</div>
<div class="verse">At this dread sign the ready spear!</div>
<div class="verse">For, as the flames this symbol sear,</div>
<div class="verse">His home, the refuge of his fear,</div>
<div class="verse">A kindred fate shall know.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sunk be his home in embers red!</div>
<div class="verse">And cursed be the meanest shed</div>

<div class="verse">Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!</div>
<div class="verse">May ravens tear the careless eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Wolves make the coward heart their prize.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Roderick’s servant, Malise, seizing the cross,
starts off through the Trossachs, and along Loch
Achray to Duncraggan, where he hands the
symbol on to “Angus, heir of Duncan’s line,”
who carries it along Vennachar and up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
pass of Leny, passing it on to a bridegroom on
Loch Lubnaig, and so it follows round all the
haunts of the clan.</p>

<p>Ellen and her father meantime retreat to a
cave on Ben Venue. Here she accidentally meets
again the fascinating stranger, who tries to
persuade her to elope with him; but she tells
him of her love for young Malcolm, and he
honourably refrains from pressing his suit; instead
he gives her a ring which, he says, was given
him by the King, with a promise that on its
production the King would fulfil any request of
the wearer. Meantime he is being watched by
Roderick Dhu as a spy, and Roderick sends a so-called
guide to conduct him out of the labyrinth;
but the guide is one of the clan Murdoch, who
has secret orders to kill the stranger so soon as
he gets him alone. The seer has proclaimed
that whichever side first kills one of the other
will win in the trial of strength now about to
begin, and when Roderick hears this he rejoices
to think that by treachery the lot will fall
to him.</p>

<p>Fitz-James, however, is warned by a half-witted
woman wandering in the wood, and when
he discloses his suspicions he is shot at by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
Murdoch, who, however, misses him and kills
the woman instead. Fitz-James, furious at this
barbarity, promptly kills him, and, cutting off a
tress of the dying woman’s hair, swears to kill the
chief, Roderick Dhu, the author of this foul
deed, whenever he shall meet him. He wanders
on in the wilderness of trees and rocks, and, as
night is coming on, he loses himself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Famished and chilled, through ways unknown,</div>
<div class="verse">Tangled and steep, he journeyed on;</div>
<div class="verse">Till, as a rock’s huge point he turned,</div>
<div class="verse">A watch-fire close before him burned.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The Fight</div>

<p>Beside it is a huge Highlander, who is at first
churlish and inclined to resent the intrusion; but
the inbred virtue of hospitality conquers, and he
allows the stranger to share his camp, promising
to see him safe as far as Coilantogle Ford next
morning. However, in the morning the two
quarrel, and the great Highlander is revealed as
Roderick Dhu himself. Roderick is furious at
hearing of the death of Murdoch, but would
have kept his word and given his guest safe-conduct
had not Fitz-James, burning to be at
him, absolved him from it, and they fight close
by the ford. Just as Roderick is about to stab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
his foe mortally he himself sinks down, overcome
with loss of blood, and some men-at-arms from
Stirling ride up, greeting Fitz-James as the King.
They carry the senseless body of Roderick back
with them to Stirling.</p>

<p>When the King is once again in his own
fortress games and sports take place, and Ellen’s
father, who has dared to attend them incognito,
reveals himself in a burst of temper and is
captured.</p>

<p>Ellen now makes her way to Stirling, carrying
the ring, which proves an Open Sesame, and
discovers to her astonishment the “knight in
Lincoln green” who wooed her in the forest is
no other than the monarch himself. James
keeps his word, forgives her father, and pledges
her to young Malcolm. Roderick, whose crimes
would have made him difficult to pardon, conveniently
dies, and the story finishes happily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scott in the Trossachs</div>

<p>Scott was very particular that the scenery of
his plot should be correct, and visited the
Trossachs carefully, and even rode from Loch
Vennachar to Stirling, to make sure of the possibility
of the feat he attributed to Fitz-James.
In view of the warlike nature of the poem,
Lockhart remarks it was rather an odd coincidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
that the first time Scott entered the
Trossachs he did so “riding in all the dignity
of danger, with a front and rear guard and loaded
arms, to enforce the execution of a legal instrument
against some Maclarens, refractory tenants
of Stewart of Appin.”</p>

THE ROYAL CITY OF STIRLING</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a good deal of the scene of the poem is laid

classic a town, a few pages must be devoted to it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">STIRLING CASTLE, FROM THE KING’S KNOT.</p>

<p class="center">In 1304 the Castle was taken by the English after a three month’s siege, and held by them
until the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The “Round Table”</div>

<p>The rock on which the castle of Stirling
stands is a most remarkable object in the landscape,
jutting out with the precipitousness of a
sea-cliff from the plain. It is absolutely inaccessible
on the one side, but slopes away on the
other, and it is on these slopes that the town
stands. Many a visitor has grumbled at the
long pull up through the narrow, and in some
places squalid, streets before reaching the castle;
but the reward is great, for the view is far-reaching.
It may be best seen, however, from a
place called the Ladies’ Rock in the churchyard,
because there it includes the castle-rock on its
steepest side. Here, also, there is to be found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
plan of all the mountains by which they
may be identified&mdash;Bens Ledi, Lomond, Vane,
More, and Voirlich; also, down below, is a
curious turf-garden, called the King’s Knot, said
to have been the scene of the mimic games and
contests of the Court. It was here Scott laid the
scene of the games described in the poem, and
with what redoubled interest can the account be
read, when, having seen the place, memory can
conjure up a mind-picture of it! This odd
terracing is mentioned by Barbour, in describing
the flight of Edward II. after Bannockburn, as
the Round Table. It is within the bounds of
possibility that it existed in the days of King
Arthur, for centuries before Arthur’s time Stirling
was a Roman station, and the King in his
day is known to have been in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The history of Stirling reaches back beyond
all records. Long before Edinburgh had attained
its position as capital of the kingdom, while it
was still but a Border fortress, liable to be taken
and retaken as English or Scots extended their
territory, Stirling was one of the strongholds
of the country. From time immemorial some
fortress had stood on this impregnable position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
In 1124 Alexander I. died here, so that it must
then have been a fortress-palace, and in 1304
the castle held out for three months against
Edward I. of England. After it was taken it
remained in the possession of England until the
Battle of Bannockburn, and Bannockburn lies
only about three miles from Stirling. Even the
supine Edward II. wended his way so far north
with the object of retaining such a desirable place.
James III. was born here, and probably James IV.
also, while James V., the hero of <cite>The Lady of
the Lake</cite>, was crowned in the parish church as
a toddling child of two. His much-discussed
daughter, Queen Mary, passed the years of her
childhood at the castle. Her little son James,
who was destined to unite the two kingdoms,
was baptized at the castle with tremendous ceremony,
while his father, Darnley, sulked apart,
and refused to take his proper position. Here
James VI. and I. spent mainly the first thirteen
years of his life, under the tutelage of the scholar
George Buchanan, and it was only when he
became King of England that Stirling ceased to
be a royal residence.</p>

<p>Of the origin of the name Stirling there is no
certain record. In old records it is spelt Stryveling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
Strivilin, and so on, through various minor
alterations, wherefore it has sometimes been held
to mean “strife,” a most appropriate signification.
It used occasionally to be referred to also as
Snowdon, a fact mentioned in Scott’s poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">For Stirling’s Tower</div>
<div class="verse">Of yore the name of Snowdon claims.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The Wandering King</div>

<p>By far the most striking part of the castle is
the palace, which was begun by James IV. and
finished by James V. This is in the form of a
square, and is decidedly French in character,
a fact attributed to the influence of his wife,
Mary of Guise. Strange life-size figures project
beneath arcades, and the carving is in some cases
most weird and grotesque. James V. was very
much associated with the castle. He was fond
of assuming disguises and wandering about
incognito among his people; for this purpose he
sometimes took the name of the “Gudeman of
Ballengeich,” Ballengeich being a road running
below the castle walls. The songs “The Gaberlunzie
Man” and “We’ll gang nae mair a-rovin”
are said to have been founded on his exploits.
He was renowned for his success with the fair
sex, and altogether the rôle given to him by
Scott fits him admirably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span></p>

<p>The castle is now occupied by a garrison, and
the picturesque Highland dress of the men adds
much as a foreground to the grey walls of the
old buildings. An awkward squad may frequently
be seen drilling in the courtyard, unkindly
exposed to the eyes of passing visitors.
In this square is the Parliament House, built by
James III., and this is where the last Parliament
in Scotland held its sittings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Douglas Room</div>

<p>The Douglas Room, reached by a narrow
passage, will, however, claim most attention
from those to whom history is a living thing.
It was here that James II. stabbed the Earl of
Douglas in 1452. The Douglases had so grown
in power and influence, that it had begun to be
a question whether Stuarts or Douglases should
reign in Scotland. The King was afraid of the
power of his mighty rivals, and accordingly
invited the Douglas, the eighth Earl, to come as
his guest to the castle for a conference. The
Douglas came without misgiving, though it is
said he demanded, and received, a safe-conduct.
It was about the middle of January, and no
doubt huge log fires warmed the inclement air
in the great draughty halls where the party dined
and supped with much appearance of cordiality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
and goodwill, but beneath lay hate and terror
and rancour, bitter as the grave.</p>

<p>After supper the King drew Douglas aside to
an inner chamber, and tried to persuade him to
break away from the allies which threatened,
with his house, to form a combination disastrous
to the security of the throne. The Earl refused,
and high words began to fly from one to the
other. The King demanded that Douglas should
break from his allies, and the Earl replied again he
would not. “Then this shall!” cried the King,
twice stabbing his guest with his own royal hand.
Sir Patrick Grey, who was near by, came up and
finished the job with a pole-axe, and then the
body was thrown over into the court below. It
was a gross violation of every law of decency
even in those lawless days, and well the King
must have known the storm his action would
arouse. Burton, the historian of Scotland,
adduces this as evidence that the crime was
not meditated, but done in a mere fit of ungovernable
rage. The murdered man’s four
brothers surrounded and besieged the castle, and
nailing to a cross in contempt the safe-conduct
the King had given, trailed it through the miry
streets tied to the tail of the wretchedest horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
they could find, thus publishing the ignominy
of their Sovereign. They burnt and destroyed
wherever they could, and the King had many
years of strenuous warfare before him as a result
of that night’s work.</p>

<p>From the castle battlements the “bonny links
of Forth” can be seen winding and looping and
doubling on themselves, and also the old bridge,
which was the key to the Highlands and the
only dry passage across the Forth for centuries.
This bridge is even older than any existing part
of the castle. It has seen many desperate skirmishes,
most notable of which was that of 1715,
when the Duke of Argyll, with only 1,500 men,
held here in check thousands of Highlanders.
Here we must leave Stirling, without noting the
rest of the old buildings, as this is no guide-book,
and the city is merely looked upon as the key to
the Trossachs and the scene of some of the drama
enacted in <cite>The Lady of the Lake</cite>.</p>

<br />
BY THE ROUTE OF THE FIERY CROSS TO BALQUHIDDER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> indeed of those who come up comfortably
by rail to Callander, and step at once to a
seat on a waiting four-horsed coach, adorned by
a scarlet-coated driver and tootling horn, ever
think of arriving a day sooner and exploring
northward along the continuation of the single
line which has brought them so far, or, better
still, of going on northward by road through
the Pass of Leny to beautiful little Strathyre for
the night. Yet they miss much by not doing so,
for at Balquhidder, a little beyond Strathyre, is
the grave of Rob Roy and the reputed graves of
his wife and son, while up the Pass of Leny
itself was carried the fiery cross, so that the story
of <cite>The Lady of the Lake</cite> is hardly complete
without a visit to it.</p>

<p>Few more beautiful passes are to be seen than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
Leny. The dashing stream which runs in a
wooded cleft below the road is exactly what one
expects a Scottish stream to be. The brown
peat-water breaks in cascades over huge grey
weather-worn stones, or lies in deep clear pools.
The irregularities of its course reveal new beauties
at every turn: the dripping green ferns, for ever
sprinkled with the spray, hang quivering over
the agate depths, and the emerald moss, saturated
like a sponge, softens the sharp angles of stones.
Tufts of free-growing heather, large as bushes,
add colour to the scene, and the slender white
stems of the birches rise gracefully amid the
gnarled alders and dark-needled firs. The Falls
of Leny are reached by a footpath from the road.</p>

<p>Angus, carrying the cross, was confronted by
the stream, which divided him from the chapel
of St. Bride, whose site is now marked by a small
graveyard just where the water issues from Loch
Lubnaig. He had to plunge in, panting and hot
as he was.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He stumbled twice&mdash;the foam splashed high,</div>
<div class="verse">With hoarser swell the stream raced by.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then, gaining the shore, he faced the chapel
entrance just as a gay crowd came forth escorting
a newly-wedded pair.</p>

<p>The railway crosses the stream about this
point, and continues up the west side of the loch,
while the road keeps on the right, or eastern, side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
The rail passes Laggan Farm, said to be the
birthplace of Rob’s Amazonian wife, Helen,
who takes a part only second to himself in the
reader’s imagination. Passing along, therefore,
on either side we come, soon after the head of
the loch, to bonny little Strathyre, lying amid its
great hills, which are flushed as if with fire when
the setting sun catches the sweep of the heather
in season.</p>

<p>Only a few miles beyond Strathyre is Balquhidder,
lying on the road to Loch Voil. The
loch lies in a very beautiful situation at the foot
of the range known as the Braes of Balquhidder,
culminating in Ben A’an and Ben More. It is
on the property of Mr. Carnegie, whose house,
Stronvar, is at the east side. In the adventurous
journey made by the Wordsworths in the beginning
of the nineteenth century, they actually
walked over the mountains to Balquhidder from
Loch Katrine by a wild, rough track, and at the
foot of the hills waded through the river. Dorothy
thus describes the scenery: “The mountains all
round are very high; the vale pastoral and
unenclosed, not many dwellings and but a few
trees; the mountains in general smooth near the
bottom. They are in large unbroken masses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
combining with the vale to give an impression of
bold simplicity.”</p>

<p class="center">It was at the end of this loch that Angus handed the Fiery Cross to the Bridegroom.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There were a few reapers in the fields, and
it was from this fact that Wordsworth was inspired
to write his poem <cite>The Solitary Reaper</cite>.
The brother and sister visited the graves at
Balquhidder before passing on to Callander.</p>

<p>It is said that when the freebooter Rob Roy
lay dying in his own house at Balquhidder, his
wife mocked at his repentance. He rebuked her,
saying: “You have put strife betwixt me and
the best men of the country, and now you
would place enmity between me and my
God.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rob Roy’s Grave</div>

<p>The grave of Rob Roy is in the little old
graveyard, and is only a few feet from the gate.
There are rude sculptured figures on the flat
stone, seemingly far older than the days of the
freebooter, but possibly an old stone was used to
mark the place where he at length rested after
his roving life. This is not the only association
that Balquhidder evokes, for it is mentioned in
<cite>The Legend of Montrose</cite>, when the Clan Macgregor
there agree to stand by the murderers
of the King’s deer-keeper; and also in more
modern fiction, when, in Stevenson’s <cite>Kidnapped</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
poor David breaks down utterly at
Balquhidder, and has to be guarded and cared
for by his quaint comrade, Alan Breck.</p>

<p>But, tempting as it is to wander farther up
the glen, here we must stop, or we shall get
too far from our legitimate route through the
Trossachs.</p>

APPROACHES TO THE TROSSACHS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> route taken by the coaches leaves Callander
in a northward direction, but soon turns off westward
down a narrow muddy road forbidden to
motor-cars; this runs beneath the shoulder of
Ben Ledi.</p>

<p>Ben Ledi means the Mount of God, and is
believed to have been held sacred from the days
when the Beltane mysteries were celebrated on it.
Beltane was a Celtic festival celebrated about
May 1 with fires and dances, and probably with
sacrifices too. The scenery, however, is not as
awe-inspiring as these weird memories would
lead one to expect&mdash;in fact, for all this first part
of the Trossachs’ round the traveller’s imagination
must supply all the fire he needs. For instance,
the very prosaic sluices erected by the Glasgow
Water Company at the end of Loch Vennachar,
which soon comes into view, mark the site of Coilantogle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
Ford, across which Roderick promised the
King a safe-conduct, and where the two fought
with such fury when the outlaw revealed himself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The chief in silence strode before,</div>
<div class="verse">And reach’d that torrent’s sounding shore</div>
<div class="verse">Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,</div>
<div class="verse">From Vennachar in silver breaks.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The road passes all along the shores of Loch
Vennachar, and where at the end there lies a
meadow, embraced on the far side by the
Finlas Water, we are at another classic spot,
for this is Lanrick Mead, the meeting-place of
the Macgregor clansmen. We can see very well
why it should have been chosen, for it guards at
its narrowest part the pass, and anyone approaching
from the Callander&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="id est">i.e.</abbr></i>, the Doune or
Stirling direction&mdash;would be easily stopped,
though it would be possible for men to come
along the south side of Lochs Vennachar and
Achray. The mead also commands the approach
from the south via Aberfoyle, and any body of
men coming down the hill on this side would be
full in view. After this we arrive at the Brig o’
Turk, a small bridge over the Finlas Water. It
was close by here, at a few huts marking Duncraggan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>

Angus. But he had done his work well.</p>

</div>

<p>We are now right in the Trossachs proper, and
find the huge, palatial hotel which goes by that
name facing little Loch Achray.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the junction of the roads&mdash;that
is, the two principal approaches already
noted&mdash;it is necessary to run over the ground
from Aberfoyle before continuing the part
through the Trossachs common to both routes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aberfoyle</div>

<p>Aberfoyle itself is full of associations, but they
are nearly all connected with <cite>Rob Roy</cite>. It
stands as a meeting-place of Highlands and Lowlands,
and as such has seen many storms. The
earlier part of the Forth, here known as the
Laggan, runs past the town, and the old saying
“Forth bridles the wild Highlandman” is full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
significance. Of this district says Mr. Cunninghame
Graham: “Nearly every hill and strath
has had its battles between the Grahames and
the Macgregors. Highlander and Lowlander
fought in the lonely glens or on the stony hills,
or drank together in the aqua-vitæ houses in the
times of their precarious peace.”</p>

<p>Far the most interesting scene laid at Aberfoyle,
in all the realism of fiction, is that in <cite>Rob
Roy</cite>, when Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and young
Osbaldistone arrived, wearied out, seeking shelter
at the primitive Clachan, and were refused because
“three Hieland shentlemens” wanted the
place to themselves. The landlady said her
house was taken up “wi’ them wadna like to be
intruded on wi’ strangers,” an objection for which
there was probably strong underlying reason!</p>

<p>The row that subsequently took place when
the stout little Bailie defended himself with the
red-hot coulter of a plough is too well known to
need quotation. Suffice it to say, in evidence of
the truth of the story, that a coulter, traditionally
said to be the very weapon, hangs on a tree
outside the hotel, which bears his name, to this
very day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pass of Aberfoyle</div>

<p>The pass which leads by Lochs Ard and Chon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
north-westward to Stronachlachar has been much
used at all times, and has seen desperate forays, but
none perhaps more desperate than that described
in <cite>Rob Roy</cite> when the Bailie and Osbaldistone,
unwillingly setting forth up it with an escort
of soldiery, were attacked from the heights above
by the redoubtable Helen Macgregor and her
men, and very narrowly escaped death. Scott
thus describes the pass:</p>

<p>“Our route, though leading toward the lake,
had hitherto been so much shaded by wood that
we only from time to time obtained a glimpse of
that beautiful sheet of water. But the road now
suddenly emerged from the forest ground, and,
winding close by the margin of the loch,
afforded us a full view of its spacious mirror,
which now, the breeze having totally subsided,
reflected in still magnificence the high dark
heathy mountains, huge grey rocks and shaggy
banks, by which it is encircled. The hills now
sank on its margin so closely, and were so
broken and precipitous, as to afford no passage
except just upon the narrow line of the track
which we occupied and which was overhung
with rocks, from which we might have been
destroyed merely by rolling down stones, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
much possibility of offering resistance. Add
to this that as the road winded round every promontory
and bay which indented the lake, there
was rarely a possibility of seeing a hundred yards
before us.”</p>

<p>It was when the party had reached a spot
where the path rose in zigzags and made its
slippery way across the face of a steep slaty cliff
that they suddenly discovered they were in an
ambuscade under the command of Helen Macgregor
herself. The desperate fight that
followed, all in favour of the outlaws who commanded
the situation; the ludicrous plight of the
fat little Bailie, who, caught by the back of the
coat on a projecting thorn-bush, swung in mid-air,
“where he dangled not unlike the sign of
the Golden Fleece over the door of a mercer in
the Trongate of his native city”&mdash;are not these
things writ in the ever-enduring pages of <cite>Rob
Roy</cite>? More awful was the doom of Morris the
Gauger, or Exciseman, who was dragged out,
condemned as a spy, and drowned by the aid of
a large stone bound in a plaid about his neck.
“Half naked and thus manacled, they hurled
him into the lake, there about twelve feet deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
with a loud halloo of vindictive triumph,
above which, however, his last death shriek,
the yell of mortal agony, was distinctly
heard.”</p>

<p>The lake thus woven into the tale is supposed
to be Loch Ard. The Falls of Ledard, at the
north-western end, are the falls described by
Scott in <cite>Waverley</cite>, as he himself has owned,
though it must be confessed in so doing he
lifted them from their setting. Flora MacIvor’s
song&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Rebels and Mossers”</div>

<p>But the Pass of Aberfoyle has scenes of real
history to tell as well as those of fiction. General
Monk led his men through it after addressing a
letter to the Earl of Airth, desiring him to have
the woods in certain districts of Aberfoyle cut
down, because they were “grete shelters to the
rebels and mossers.”</p>

<p>In the pass, also, the Earl of Glencairn and
Graham of Duchray defeated some of the Cromwellian
soldiers, and, adds Mr. Cunninghame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
Graham in recounting the incident, “Graham of
Duchray no doubt fought all the better because
the Cromwellians had burnt his house the night
before the action, in order to show him that it
was unwise to attach too much importance to
mere houses built with hands.”</p>

<p>Aberfoyle is supposed to be peculiarly haunted
by the “little folk”&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="id est">i.e.</abbr></i>, the fairies&mdash;a reputation
it gained from a seventeenth-century minister,
who was supposed to be in league with them.
He is frequently mentioned by Scott, and the
fairy knowe, opposite the hotel, on which he
sank down dead, called back to the fairyland he
loved so well, is still pointed out. He,</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lake of Menteith</div>

<p>Not less interesting than the west side is the
country lying east of Aberfoyle, where, at about an
equal distance, is the lake of Menteith. As significant
of the wildness of the place in bygone days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
we may note that one Earl of Menteith declared
war against “all but the kinge and those of the
name of Grahame.” Menteith was from earliest
times one of the five great districts into which
Scotland was divided. The Earls of Menteith
(Grahams) were ever at feud with the warlike
Macgregors, and, as often happens, the feuds raged
worst just on the borders of the Highlands,
where men might attack and retreat in safety,
knowing every track which led into their wild
fastnesses.</p>

<p>The lake of Menteith is about two miles by
one, and it is curious to note this is the only
<em>lake</em> in Scotland. On it is an island, where the
Earls had their residence. Another island, called
Inchmahone, is, however, more interesting still.
The word means “Isle of Rest,” and such it was
found by the monks who lived here in ages long
gone past. Ruins are left, a moulded doorway,
a fine monument, to tell of their occupation, but
“gone are the Augustinian monks who built the
stately island church. Out of the ruined chancel
grows a plane-tree, which is almost ripe. In the
branches rooks have built their nests, and make as
cheerful matins as perhaps the monks themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
The giant chestnuts, grown, as tradition says,
from chestnuts brought from Rome, are all stag-headed.
Ospreys used to build in them in the
memory of those still living. Gone are the
'Riders of Menteith’ (if they ever existed); the
ruggers and the reivers are at one with those they
harried. The Grahams and Macgregors, the
spearmen and the jackmen, the hunters and the
hawkers, the livers by their spurs, the luckless
Earls of Menteith and their retainers, are buried
and forgotten, and the tourist cracks his biscuit
and his jest over their tombs” (Cunninghame
Graham).</p>

<p>The “Riders of Menteith” are spoken of in
history, but whether, as Mr. Graham asks, they
were mortal riders or a sort of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Walküren</i>, sacred
to the Valhalla of the district, history does not
enlighten us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Four Maries</div>

<p>Queen Mary, as a little girl of five, was
brought to the island of Inchmahone after the
Battle of Pinkie, and lived here for a whole year,
until she went to France to be betrothed to the
Dauphin. Her childish dreams beneath the
great chestnuts can have contained no shadow of
the stormy life and fearful end that awaited her.
She was even at that time accompanied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
“four Maries” who attended on her, one of
whom, Mary Hamilton, met the tragic fate of
execution.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>The road from Aberfoyle to the Trossachs
rises very steeply past some slate-quarries. As
we rise the hills come into view&mdash;Ben Ledi and
Ben Venue, with Ben Lomond dominating all
the landscape; Ben Voil peeping over Ben
Lawers; and on the clearest days, far in the
distance, Ben Nevis, Schiehallion, and many
others. Far below to the right lies Loch
Drunkie, and much nearer the desolate little
tarn called Loch Reoichte, which signifies
“frozen,” and this among them all for desolate
beauty stands first. Close by the road is a drinking-fountain,
called “Rob Roy’s Well,” where
the tourist is invited to slake his thirst, though
the real well, to which the tradition attaches, is
away from the road, above the slate-quarries on
Craig Vadh. On the ridge of this same Craig
Vadh, by the way, are curious cairns, covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
the spot where the bodies of those slain in a
Border foray were found. When the road at
length descends we have the pleasing duty of
paying an impost, or toll, for the use of it&mdash;and by
no means a low one either&mdash;and thus we come to
Loch Achray and the Trossachs Hotel, and pick
up the thread where it was dropped.</p>

<br />
THE HEART OF THE TROSSACHS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> we have heard the Trossachs signifies “bristled
territory,” a suitable name enough, and as they
have been described by the master himself, there
would be little use in trying to improve upon
his words, which are as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With boughs that quaked at every breath,</div>
<div class="verse">Grey birch and aspen wept beneath;</div>
<div class="verse">Aloft, the ash and warrior oak</div>
<div class="verse">Cast anchor in the rifted rock;</div>
<div class="verse">And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung</div>
<div class="verse">His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,</div>
<div class="verse">Where seem’d the cliffs to meet on high,</div>
<div class="verse">His boughs athwart the narrow’d sky.</div>
<div class="verse">Highest of all where white peaks glanced,</div>
<div class="verse">Where glistening streamers waved and danced,</div>
<div class="verse">The wanderer’s eye could barely view</div>
<div class="verse">The summer heaven’s delicious blue;</div>
<div class="verse">So wondrous wild, the whole might seem</div>
<div class="verse">The scenery of a fairy dream.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Dorothy Wordsworth</div>

<p>It must be remembered that the beautiful even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
road which now runs through the heart of this
fairyland was a work of great difficulty and cost.
It has been hewn out of the side of the rock,
and built up by the side of the loch in order to
facilitate the constant stream of tourists. At first
there were several wild pathways leading down
to Loch Katrine through a perfect wilderness of
boughs and undergrowth, and at the end a precipitous
drop over the edge of a steep crag, only
scaled by the aid of a sort of natural ladder of
saplings and tendrils, and it is thus that Scott
makes Fitz-James approach the loch. In the
beginning of the nineteenth century, however,
when Dorothy Wordsworth and her brother
reached the Trossachs from Loch Katrine, a
great improvement had taken place. When
nearing the end of the lake, she says, they came
in sight of two huts, which had been built by
Lady Perth as a shelter for visitors. “The
huts stand at a small distance from each other,
on a high and perpendicular rock, that rises from
the bed of the lake. A road, which has a very
wild appearance, has been cut through the rock;
yet even here, among these bold precipices, the
feeling of excessive beautifulness overcomes every
other.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SILVER STRAND, LOCH KATRINE.</p>

<p class="center">Where Scott describes the meeting between Fitz-James and Ellen of the Isle.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p>In her there was already that new appreciation
of the natural beauty which her brother was to
do so much to encourage in all. Her description
of the Trossachs, after they had landed, clearly
shows this: “Above and below us, to the right
and to the left, were rocks, knolls, and hills,
which, whenever anything could grow&mdash;and that
was everywhere between the rocks&mdash;were
covered with trees and heather. The trees did
not in any place grow so thick as an ordinary
wood, yet I think there was never a bare space of
twenty yards; it was more like a natural forest,
where the trees grow in groups or singly, not
hiding the surface of the ground, which, instead
of being green and mossy, was of the richest
purple. The heather was indeed the most
luxuriant I ever saw; it was so tall that a child
of ten years old struggling through it would
often have been buried head and shoulders, and
the exquisite beauty of the colour, near or at a
distance, seen under the trees is not to be conceived.”</p>

<p>And as it was then so it is now: a better
description of the peculiar scenery of the Trossachs
could hardly be given, especially if we add the
detail that bog-myrtle and birches grow abundantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
adding to the fragrance and poetry of the
place. Winding round to the right runs the
road to the Silver Strand, now much covered by
the rising of the water owing to the precautions
taken by the Glasgow Waterworks, which gets
its supply from Loch Katrine. Here Fitz-James
is supposed to have stood. Right in front is
Ellen’s Isle, thickly wooded; behind it rises the
vast shoulder of Ben Venue, and away to the
right stretches westward the full length of the
lake, broken by promontories,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>In the whole of a justly celebrated poem there
is no passage finer than this, and, oft quoted as it
has been, it would be impossible to omit it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span></p>

<p>Ellen’s Isle is, of course, so named after Scott’s
heroine; the Highland name is Eilean Molach,
meaning the “Shaggy Island,” and it is quite
likely that with this in his mind Scott chose
the name Ellen as the nearest English-sounding
equivalent.</p>

<p>The Goblin’s Cave, to which Ellen and her
family retreated, is on the side of Ben Venue,
and above is the Bealach Nambo, or the Pass of
the Cattle, which Scott alluded to as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The dell upon the mountain’s crest</div>
<div class="verse">Yawned like a gash on warrior’s breast.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This can be reached on foot by a not too difficult
walk, but most people prefer to view it from
below. The Goblin’s Cave is impossible of
exact identification, if, indeed, it had any actual
prototype.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loch Katrine</div>

<p>It has been suggested that the name of Loch
Katrine arose from the hordes of robbers, or
caterans, who infested its shores. If this be so,
the name has been softened into something much
more appropriate to the loveliness of the scenery,
which is at its best at the east end. The
Wordsworth party, indeed, coming from the
other end, were at first disappointed. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
only means of transit was by a small row-boat,
Coleridge was afraid of the cold and walked along
the northern shore from Glengyle, though not,
of course, on the well-made-up road which runs
part of the way at present. Wordsworth himself
slept in the bottom of the boat, which they had
procured with much difficulty, and told his sister
to awake him if anything worth seeing occurred.
It was not until they nearly reached the eastern
end that she did this, though then she confessed
that what they saw was “the perfection of
loveliness and beauty.”</p>

<p>The lake is about eight miles long by three-quarters
broad, but the actual width varies very
much, owing to the numerous indentations. The
road on the northern shore runs to Glengyle, but
there stops, so that the only means of getting
right on to Loch Lomond is to take the steamer,
which awaits tourists several times daily. No
doubt a road by which cyclists could travel on their
own account would be strenuously resisted in the
neighbourhood, where the chief aim and object of
the tourist’s being is supposed to be to pay for
everything. On the southern side the steepness
of the precipices of Ben Venue prevents any
possibility of a road.</p>

<div class="figcenter w800"><a id="loch_katrine"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span></p>

<p>Opposite to Ben Venue, and best seen from the
lake itself, is Ben A’an, only 1,750 feet in height.
At the north-west end of Loch Katrine is Glengyle,
the hereditary burial-place of the Macgregors.</p>

<p>The steamer stops at Stronachlachar, about
three-quarters of the way down the lake on
the south side, and here a coach meets it to
convey passengers across to Inversnaid, on Loch
Lomond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Stepping Westward”</div>

<p>With Loch Katrine the scenes identified with
<cite>The Lady of the Lake</cite> come to an end. The
road to Loch Lomond passes over a wild, rough
heath, in strong contrast to the wooded loveliness
of the eastern end of Loch Katrine, but quite as
attractive to some natures, especially when the
soft grey clouds lie low and the russets and
browns of the bracken and heather replace
the rich glory of its purple robe. It was hereabouts
that the Wordsworths, when returning to
Lomond, were greeted by two Highland women,
who said in a friendly way: “What! you are
stepping westward”&mdash;a simple sentence which
gave Wordsworth the inspiration for the poem
which he wrote long afterwards beginning with
the same words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Real Rob Roy</div>

<p>Loch Arklet lies very flat between its shores,
and has no beauty except its wildness. At one end
lived for some time Rob Roy and his wife;
indeed, all this district, right up to Glen Falloch
on the one side, and down to the shoulders of
Ben Lomond on the other, is associated with the
outlaw, of whom Scott made a hero. The
district has also associations with a much greater
than he, for it is redolent of the wanderings of
Robert the Bruce, when he was hunted by his
bitter enemies, the men of Lorn.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Roderick Dhu in Scott’s
poem was a shadowy form of Rob Roy, who is
more developed in the book which was published
seven years later. Both were of uncommon
personal strength, both were cattle-lifters and outlaws,
both were of the great clan of Macgregor,
and there are minor resemblances.</p>

<div class="figcenter w800"><a id="ben_aan"></a>
<img src="images/illus_fp_49.jpg" width="800" height="553" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BEN A’AN (Seen from Loch Katrine).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Rob’s designation was “of Inversnaid,” and he
owned Craig Royston, a district lying east of
Lomond, near the north end. He began as a man
of property and a land-holder, rough and poor as
his territory was. He went on to be a cattle-dealer
on a large scale, and this turned to something
more nefarious. A distraint was levied on
his property, and he had to leave the shores of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
Lomond. To this fact is attributed the wild
piper’s tune of “The Lament of Rob Roy,”
composed by his wife, which has something of
the mournful beauty of the country incorporated
in its weird strains:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Through the depths of Loch Lomond the steed shall career,</div>
<div class="verse">O’er the heights of Ben Lomond the galley shall steer,</div>
<div class="verse">And the rocks of Craig Royston like icicles melt,</div>
<div class="verse">Ere our wrongs be forgot, or our vengeance unfelt.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Rob seems to have been in some way a Robin
Hood, exercising generosity toward those poorer
and weaker than himself, and he was greatly
beloved by the people in consequence. Many a
ballad is connected with his name, and he became
a popular hero even before his death. He took
part in 1715 Rebellion on the Jacobite side, and
at the Battle of Sheriffmuir seems to have been
afflicted with the peculiar indecision that paralyzed
both sides on that memorable day. He was
leading, beside his own clan, a party of Macphersons,
whose chief was too infirm to take the field,
and he retained his station on a hill, though
positively ordered by the Earl of Mar to charge.
It is said that this charge might have decided the
day. This incident is embodied in the ballad on
the occasion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">Rob Roy he stood watch</div>
<div class="verse indent4">On a hill for to catch</div>
<div class="verse">The booty for aught that I saw, mon;</div>
<div class="verse indent4">For he ne’er advanced</div>
<div class="verse indent4">From the place where he stanced</div>
<div class="verse">Till nae mair was to do there at a’, mon.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is impossible to give even an account of
all Rob’s pranks, some of which are doubtless
mythical, and others which do not greatly redound
to his credit. He had certainly that
picturesque personality which has attracted
romancers in all ages, and he formed a very
fitting subject for Scott’s pen.</p>

<p>In the end he turned Roman Catholic, and
died, as already stated, at Balquhidder.</p>

<p>The road drops very steeply down to Lomond,
and passes the earthworks which mark the site of
a fort built by William III. to overawe the
rebels. The fort, being on the great outlaw’s
property, was an object of peculiar hatred. Twice
it was surprised and taken&mdash;once by Roy himself
and once by his nephew. It is said that at one
time General, then Captain, Wolfe was in command
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Highland Girl</div>

<p>The little stream Arklet dances and brawls
over its bed, in its descent accompanying the road,
and at length leaps into the lake by a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
waterfall thirty feet in height. Close by this is
the palatial hotel at Inversnaid, a brother to the
one at the Trossachs. When the Wordsworths
arrived here the first time, after having with great
difficulty got across Loch Lomond in a row-boat,
they found only a miserable ferry-house, with a
mud floor, and rain coming in at the roof. It
was here that Wordsworth saw the prototype of
his “sweet Highland girl.”</p>

<br />
LOMOND AND THE MACGREGORS</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Ben Lomond</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lomond</span> is one of the two most magnificent lochs
in Scotland. It is twenty-one miles long, its
only rival being Loch Awe, which is three miles
longer. It is of a curious wedge shape, being
about five miles broad at the low end and
narrowing to a point in the north. In the
widest part it bears a perfect archipelago of
islands, once thickly populated, but now left
mostly to deer and other wild creatures. There
is a tradition of a floating island, repeated by
many an ancient traveller; but all trace of this
phenomenon has vanished&mdash;if, indeed, it ever
existed. The fishing in the loch is free, and
salmon, sea-trout, lake-trout, pike, and perch are
to be caught. The nearness of the great lake to
Glasgow is at once an advantage and a drawback.
It is an advantage for the thousands that pour out
of the grimy city on every holiday, and, at half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
an hour from their own doors, for a trifling
sum, can spend joyous days in scenery which can
be classed with the most beautiful in the world.
But it is certainly not an unmixed joy to the real
lover of Nature, who approaches the lake in a
spirit of worship, to find the shores black with
people and the steamers thronged with tourists.
The attractions pointed out to those who pass up
or down the great sheet of water are various. Not
the least is the giant Ben, who raises his proud
head on the eastern side, “a sort of Scottish
Vesuvius, never wholly without a cloud-cap.
You cannot move a step that it does not tower
over you. In winter a vast white sugar-loaf; in
summer a prismatic cone of yellow and amethyst
and opaline lights; in spring a grey, gloomy,
stony pile of rocks; in autumn a weather indicator,
for when the mist curls down its sides and
hangs in heavy wreaths from its double summit,
‘it has to rain,’ as the Spaniards say.”</p>

<p>The mountain is 3,192 feet high, and the
ascent is not difficult; by the gradually sloping
way from the hotel at Rowardennan it is about
five or six miles, without any very stiff climbing,
and there is a choice of other routes. On a
clear day, which is a rare boon, the view from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
the summit is superb. Sitting on its topmost
pinnacle, one looks down the almost perpendicular
north-eastern slope into the little valley where
the River Forth may be said to take its rise. On
the western side Loch Lomond stretches out in
full length, and across the narrow isthmus of
Tarbet is the sea-loch, Loch Long. Far away to
the east and south the eye may range over the
Lothians, Edinburgh, and Arthur’s Seat, and even
to the distant hills of Cumberland and the Isle of
Man; while farther west, backed by the Irish
coast, is the whole scenery of the beautiful Clyde
estuary and the nearer Hebrides. Northward,
peak after peak, rise the stately masses of the
Grampians.</p>

<p>Leaving Inversnaid, the first point to which
attention is usually drawn is the cave in the
corries on the east side, called Rob Roy’s Cave;
much farther down the loch, amid the screes of
Ben Lomond, is another hole, called Rob Roy’s
Prison. The Island Vow, midway across the
loch opposite Inversnaid, owes its name to a
corruption of Eilean Vhow, meaning the
Brownies’ Isle, a fascinating enough name to
a child. On the island are some remains of the
Macfarlanes’ stronghold. Wordsworth’s poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
<cite>The Brownie</cite> originated with this island. On
the farther shore, a little more northward, there
is what is called the Pulpit Rock, a cell cut out
on the face of the cliff so that it could be used
for open-air preaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Macfarlanes</div>

<p>Right opposite is Ben Voirlich, and, in its
fastnesses, wild Loch Sloy, whose name formed
the war-cry of the Macfarlanes.</p>

<p>The reputation of this clan was not far behind
the Macgregors as far as desperate courage and
mad savagery count. Their headquarters were
at first on the Isle of Inveruglas, just near the outflow
of that stream into the loch; then they
moved to the Brownies’ Island, doubtless finding
the near neighbourhood of their hereditary
enemies, the men of Lorn, too dangerous; but
subsequently, becoming bolder, they went to
Tarbet, and there settled.</p>

<p>The name Tarbet means draw-boat, and the
story goes that Haco, King of Norway, in 1263
entered Loch Long, and, sailing up it, made his
men drag the long flat-bottomed boats across the
isthmus, and launch them on Loch Lomond, in
order that he might the more easily attack the
people on its shores for plunder.</p>

<p>The next point of interest is the promontory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
of Luss, which gives its name to Colquhoun of
Luss, whose seat is on the next most beautiful
wooded promontory at Rossdhu. This family is
one of the most ancient on record, being able to
trace its ancestry back to the Colquhouns in
1190 and the Lusses in 1150, which two
families were united in the main line by the
marriage of a Colquhoun with the heiress of
Luss about 1368. Mrs. Walford, the well-known
novelist, is a scion of this family. The
present mansion was built about the end of the
eighteenth century, but a fragment of the old
ancestral home is still standing. Not far off are
Court Hill and Gallows Hill, where the chieftain
tried delinquents, and where justice was meted
out to them. The slogan of the clan means
“Knoll of the willow.”</p>

<p>Across the loch, on the opposite side, is Ross
Priory, where Scott was staying with his friend
Hector Macdonald when he wrote part of <cite>Rob
Roy</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Islands</div>

<p>Just about here we are in a perfect world of
islands, some of which&mdash;notably Inchmurrin&mdash;are
preserved as a deer-park. At the south end
are the ruins of a castle once inhabited by the
Earls of Lennox, who belonged to the Macfarlane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
clan. Here Isabel, Duchess of Albany, retired
when her father, husband, and sons had been
executed at Stirling in 1424. Of the other
islands, we have the names of Inchchlonaig,
meaning the Island of Yew-trees, on which the
yews are said to have been planted by Robert
Bruce to furnish bows for his archers; Inchtavannach,
or Monks’ Island; Inchcruin, Round
Island; Inchfad, Long Island; and Inchcaillach,
the Island of Women, from a nunnery once
established here. This is close to the Pier of
Balmaha, where is the entrance to a pass over
the mountains, a well-known road in the old
days of tribal war and bloodshed.</p>

<p>The Wordsworths landed on Inchtavannach,
and climbed to the top of it. Here is Dorothy’s
description: “We had not climbed far before
we were stopped by a sudden burst of prospect,
so singular and beautiful that it was like a flash
of images from another world. We stood with
our backs to the hill of the island, which we
were ascending, and which shut out Ben Lomond
entirely and all the upper part of the lake, and
we looked toward the foot of the lake, scattered
over with islands, without beginning and without
end. The sun shone, and the distant hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
were visible&mdash;some through sunny mists, others in
gloom with patches of sunshine; the lake was
lost under the low and distant hills, and the
islands lost in the lake, which was all in motion,
with travelling fields of light, or dark shadows
under rainy clouds. There are many hills, but
no commanding eminence at a distance to confine
the prospect, so that the land seemed endless as
the water.... Immediately under my eyes
lay one large flat island bare and green ...
another, its next neighbour, was covered with
heath and coppice wood, the surface undulating....
These two islands, with Inchtavannach,
where we were standing, were intermingled
with the water, I might say interbedded, and
interveined with it, in a manner that was
exquisitely pleasing. There were bays innumerable,
straits or passages like calm rivers, land-locked
lakes, and, to the main water, stormy
promontories.”</p>

<p>Not far from Rossdhu, on the west, is the
entrance to Glen Fruin, the Glen of Weeping&mdash;a
sad name, which turned out to be appropriate
enough in view of the terrible scenes which
happened here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Macgregors</div>

<p>The trouble began with the Macgregors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
Their clan claimed descent from the third son of
Alpine, King of the Scots, who lived about 787,
and was therefore known by the alternative
name of Clan Alpine. Their savage ways made
them hated by their neighbours, and the Earls of
Argyll and Breadalbane managed to obtain from
the Government a right by charter to a great part
of the lands belonging to the unfortunate clan.
This, of course, was the signal for a fight to the
death.</p>

<p>From the time of Queen Mary onward various
warrants were given to the other clans to make
war on the unfortunate Macgregors, and to
extirpate them as they would vermin. They
were not only to be hounded out of existence,
but the other clans were forbidden to supply
them with the common necessaries of life. The
climax was reached in the slaughter of Glen
Fruin, which arose in this wise: Two of the
Macgregors, being benighted, called at the house
of one of the Colquhouns, and asked shelter.
This was refused. They accordingly helped
themselves to a sheep and supped off mutton,
for which it is alleged they offered payment.
The Laird of Luss seized them and had them
both executed. Then the rest of the clan arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
in wrath, and, to the number of three or four
hundred strong, marched down to Luss. Sir
Humphrey Colquhoun, receiving warning of
their advance, called together his clansmen and
others, to double the number of the invaders, and
advanced to meet them, doing so in Glen Fruin.</p>

<p>The clan of the Macgregors charged the
Colquhouns with fury, and, owing to the fact
that part of the opposing force was mounted, and
that the horses got mired in the boggy ground,
they were able, notwithstanding their inferiority
of numbers, to get the best of it, whereupon
they set upon their flying foes and slaughtered
them mercilessly.</p>

<p>The event which, however, lives in memory
longest is that of the action of a gigantic
Macgregor, called Dugald Ciar Mohr, or the
“great mouse-coloured man,” who was in charge,
as their tutor, of a party of youths from
Glasgow. It is said that, excited by the sound
of his clansmen shouting their war-cry, or
incensed by the remarks of the youths against
his clan, he lost his head; anyway, he slew them
all in cold blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Clerk’s Stone</div>

<p>The great stone called Leck-a-Mhinisteir, the
“minister or clerk’s stone,” is still pointed out as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
the place where this horrid deed was done, and
it is said the stone was bathed red in the blood of
the hapless boys. This Dugald was the ancestor
of Rob Roy and his tribe.</p>

<p>The terrible song put by Sir Walter Scott into
the mouths of the Macgregor boatmen carries
with it a wild cry of savagery:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen Fruin,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And Bannacha’s groans to our slogan replied;</div>
<div class="verse">Glen Luss and Rossdhu they are smoking in ruin;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And the best of Loch Lomond lie dead on its side.</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Widow and Saxon maid</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Long shall lament our raid,</div>
<div class="verse">Think of Clan Alpine with fear and with woe;</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Lennox and Leven Glen</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Shake when they hear again</div>
<div class="verse">Roderick vich Alpine dhu! ho feroe!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After this defeat the fury and wrath of the
other clans, who were in favour at Court, may be
imagined, and the widows of the slain men, to
the number of several score, were sent, dressed
in deep mourning, and riding upon white
palfreys, carrying each her husband’s bloody
shirt, to demand vengeance of King James VI.
on the Macgregors. The Court was then at
Stirling, and surely Stirling never saw a more
woesome sight! The vengeance they obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
was all that they could desire, for by an Act of
Privy Council, dated April 3, 1603, the name of
Macgregor was wiped out of the land, all those
who bore it being compelled, under dire penalties,
to adopt the name of some other clan; hence it
was that Rob Roy was known as Rob Roy
Macgregor Campbell. The Macgregors were forbidden
to carry any weapons, and were otherwise
penalized. The chief, Alistair Macgregor, who
had led the fight at Glen Fruin, was seized, and
hanged in 1604. Yet, in spite of these and
other dire disabilities, the Macgregors continued
to be Macgregors in heart, whatever they might
call themselves, and held their heads as high as
their own crest, a pine-tree. They attached
themselves to the cause of King Charles in the
Civil Wars, and were subsequently rewarded by
the annulling of the Acts and having their
rights restored to them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
